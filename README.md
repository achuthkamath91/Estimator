## Development Environment Setup ##

Regardless of your development platform, the first step is to download or clone this repository.

Once you have the code for the simulator, you will need to install the necessary compiler and IDE necessary for running the simulator.

Here are the setup and install instructions for each of the recommended IDEs for each different OS options:

2. Select *Open Project / Solution* and open `<simulator>/Simulator.sln`
3. From the *Project* menu, select the *Retarget solution* option and select the Windows SDK that is installed on your computer (this should have been installed when installing Visual Studio or upon opening of the project).
4. To compile and run the project / simulator, simply click on the green play button at the top of the screen.  When you run the simulator, you should see a single quadcopter, falling down.
